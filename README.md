## Bezier Curve Demonstrations
In this project I will be using different methods of calculating Simple Bezier Curves and demonstrate their structures

- Using Linear Interpolations (Lerps)
- Using De Castelijau Algorithm 

### Uses for Bezier Curves

- Computer Graphics: Bezier curves are extensively used in computer graphics for smooth and visually appealing curve representations allowing for the creation of curved shapes and paths.

- Animation: They play a crucial role in animation, enabling the design of fluid and realistic motion paths for objects, characters, and camera movements.

- Font Design: Bezier curves are fundamental in font creation, providing a flexible method to define the precise shapes of letters and characters in typefaces.

- CAD (Computer-Aided Design): Bezier curves are employed in CAD applications for designing curves and surfaces, allowing engineers and designers to model and manipulate complex shapes with precision.

- Robotics and Path Planning: In robotics, Bezier curves are used for path planning, enabling robots to navigate smoothly through predefined trajectories, avoiding obstacles with controlled and predictable motion.
